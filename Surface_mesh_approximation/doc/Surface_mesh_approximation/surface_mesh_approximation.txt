\section sma_introduction Introduction

At the core of numerous applications ranging from geometry compression to reverse engineering, finding the concise and faithful approximation of an excessively verbose 3D data (in particular, scanned meshes) is the key for subsequent geometry processing and reducing the computational cost.

This package implements the <em>Variational Shape Approximation</em> \cgalCite{botsch2010PMP} (VSA) framework to approximate the triangle surface. Given a triangulated surface mesh (simply <em>mesh</em> in the following), the VSA uses the Lloyd's iteration to drive the distortion error down with the concept of geometryic <em>proxy</em>. The overview of the algorithm can be found in \ref sma_approximation.

This package offers both the approximation and the approximated mesh extraction functions. They can be accessed as simple free functions or advanced class-based interfaces. This allows an alternative approach to used the default metrics or plug the user-defined proxy and metrics into the VSA framework. It can be viewed as not only an approximation package, but also a simplification, shape discovery one or a complement to current mesh segmentation package.

\section sma_overview Overview of the Approximation Process

\subsection sma_approximation Approximation

Explain: Proxy, Metric, LLoyd, Initialization

The proxy is simply a parameterized description of a facets patch. This package provide the simple basic `PlaneProxy` which .

\subsection sma_extraction Mesh Extraction

Explain: Anchor, Pseudo-CDT, Non-manifold.

\subsection sma_interface Interface

This package can thus be used either with `Polyhedron_3`, `Surface_mesh`, or
any class model of the concept `FaceGraph` described in \ref chapterBGL.

Approximate a triangle mesh and extract the approximated triangle surface, using:
- `CGAL::vsa_approximate()` : given a triangle mesh, approximate the geometry and output the facet proxy index map.
- `CGAL::vsa_extract()` : given a triangle mesh, approximate the geometry and output the approximated triangle surface.
- `CGAL::vsa_approximate_and_extract()` : given a triangle mesh, approximate the geometry, output the facet proxy index map and extract the approximated triangle surface.

\section sma_examples Examples

\subsection sma_example1 Approximate a Mesh

The following example calls the functions `CGAL::vsa_extract()` on the input triangle mesh.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_approximation/vsa_extraction_example.cpp}

\subsection sma_example2 Using L2 metric

The following example use the L2 metric to approximate the shape.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_approximation/vsa_l2_metric_example.cpp}

\subsection sma_example3 User-defined Proxy

We could use self-defined proxy and error for the approximation algorithm. In the following example, we define a simple point-wise proxy to achieve a compact patch approximation of the shape:
