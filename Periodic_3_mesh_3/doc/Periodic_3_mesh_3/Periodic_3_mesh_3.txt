\section Periodic_3_mesh_3_section_intro Introduction

This package is devoted to the generation of isotropic simplicial
meshes discretizing periodic 3D domains.
The domain to be meshed is a region of the three-dimensional flat torus
(see Section \ref P3Triangulation3secspace).
The region may be connected or composed of multiple components
and/or subdivided in several subdomains.

Boundary and subdivision surfaces are either
smooth or piecewise-smooth surfaces, formed with planar or curved surface patches.
Surfaces may exhibit 1-dimensional features (e.g. crease edges)
and 0-dimensional features (e.g. singular points as corners
tips, cusps or darts), that have to be fairly approximated in the mesh.

The output mesh is a periodic 3-dimensional triangulation,
including subcomplexes that approximate each input domain feature: subdomain,
boundary surface patch or input domain feature with dimension 0 or 1.
Thus, the output mesh includes a 3D submesh covering each subdomain,
a surface mesh approximating each boundary or subdividing
surface patch, a polyline approximation for each
1-dimensional feature and of course a vertex on each corner.

The main entry points of the package are two global functions that
respectively generate and refine such meshes. The mesh generator is customized
to output a mesh that fits as much as possible the user needs,
for instance in terms of sizing field or with respect
to some user customized quality criteria.

The meshing engine used in this mesh generator is based on Delaunay
refinement \cgalCite{c-gqmgc-93}, \cgalCite{r-draq2d-95}, \cgalCite{s-tmgdr-98}.
It uses the notion of restricted Delaunay triangulation
to approximate 1-dimensional curves and surface patches \cgalCite{cgal:bo-pgsms-05}.
Before the refinement, a mechanism of protecting balls is set up on 1-dimensional features, if any,
to ensure a fair representation of those features in the mesh,
and also to guarantee the termination of the refinement process,
whatever may be the input geometry, in particular whatever small angles
the boundary and subdivision surface patches may form \cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07},
\cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07}. The Delaunay refinement is followed
by a mesh optimization phase to remove slivers and provide a good quality mesh.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3Mesh_3 Relation to the 3D Mesh Generation Package

This package is fundamentally linked to the package \ref PkgMesh_3Summary,
referred from now on as "the Mesh_3 package", or simply `Mesh_3`.

A periodic mesh extends, by definition, infinitely in space. To avoid storing and
manipulating duplicate points, well-chosen "dummy" points are inserted
at the beginning of the meshing process, thus ensuring that the triangulation forms
at all times a simplicial complex within a single fundamental copy of the domain
(see Sections \ref P3Triangulation3secspace and \ref P3Triangulation3secintro
of the manual of 3D periodic triangulations).
The meshing process can then be exclusively conducted in the fundamental domain.
This single copy of the complete periodic mesh is generated using
the three-dimensional mesh generator of %CGAL (see package: \ref PkgMesh_3Summary).
Since `Mesh_3` only supports traditional (non-periodic) domains,
it must be provided adapted oracles to handle the periodicity of the input domain
and of the mesh.
This package provides these necessary tools to be able to use %CGAL's three-dimensional
mesh generator with %CGAL's 3D periodic triangulations.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3InputDomain Input Domain

The domain to be meshed is assumed to live within a (non-necessarily unit)
periodic cube. Furthermore, it is assumed to be representable as a pure 3D complex.
A 3D complex is a set of faces with dimension 0, 1, 2, and 3
such that all faces are pairwise interior disjoint, and the boundary
of each face of the complex is the union of faces of the complex.
The 3D complex is *pure*, meaning that each face is included in a face of dimension 3,
so that the complex is entirely described by the set of its 3D faces and their subfaces.
However the 3D complex needs not be connected.
The set of faces with dimension lower or equal than 2 forms a 2D
subcomplex which needs not be manifold, neither pure, nor connected:
some 3D faces may have dangling 2D or 1D faces in their boundary faces.

In the rest of the documentation, we will refer to the
input 3D complex as the input domain. The faces of the input domain
with dimension 0, 1, 2, and 3 are called respectively
<I>corners</I>, <I>curves</I>, <I>surface patches</I>, and <I>subdomains</I>
to clearly distinguish them from the faces of the mesh
that are called vertices, edges, facets and cells.

Note that the input complex faces are not required to be linear nor smooth.
Surface patches, for instance, may be smooth surface patches,
or portions of surface meshes with boundaries.

Note also that input complex faces are not required to be connected.
Faces of the input domain are identified by indexes.
If a subdomain is not connected, its different components receive the same index.
Likewise different surface patches, segment curves, or corners may share the same index.
Each connected component of a feature will be accurately represented
in the final mesh.
Note however that the occurrence of multiply connected faces in the
input complex may affect the relevance of internal topological checks
performed by the mesh generator. Also, the mesh generator
will not be able to apply different meshing criteria, e.g. different
sizing field, for the different connected components of a single feature.

The domain is passed to the mesh generation function
as a domain class, often called the oracle,
that provides predicates and constructors related to the domain,
the subdomains, and the boundary surface patches.
Mainly, the oracle provides a predicate to test
if a given query point belongs to the periodic domain or not
and to find in which subdomain it lies in the affirmative case.
The domain class also provides predicates and constructors to test the intersection of a query line segment
with the boundary surface patches and to build some intersection points if any.

The current implementation provides classes to represent
domains bounded by isosurfaces of implicit functions.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3OutputMesh Output Mesh

The resulting mesh is output as a subcomplex of a periodic 3D Delaunay triangulation,
in a class providing various iterators on mesh elements.

The periodic 3D triangulation provides approximations of the subdomains,
surface patches, curves, and corners according to the restricted
Delaunay triangulation paradigm. This means that each subdomain is approximated
by the union of the tetrahedral cells whose circumcenters are located inside
the domain (or subdomain).
Each surface patch is approximated by the union of the Delaunay mesh facets
whose dual Voronoi edges intersect the surface patch. Such mesh facets are called
<I>surface facets</I> in the following. The 1-dimensional exposed features
are approximated by sequences of mesh edges and the 0-dimensional exposed features
are represented by mesh vertices.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3OutputFaceGraph Output FaceGraph

This \cgal component also provides a function to convert the reconstructed mesh to a `FaceGraph`:
`facets_in_complex_3_to_triangle_mesh()`.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3DelaunayRefinement Delaunay Refinement

The mesh generation algorithm is mainly a Delaunay refinement process.
This Delaunay refinement process is driven by criteria
concerning either the size and shape of mesh cells
and surface facets.
The refinement process terminates when there are
no more mesh cells or surface facets violating the criteria.

The criteria are designed to achieve a nice spread of the mesh vertices
while ensuring the termination of the refinement process.
Those criteria may be somehow tuned to the user needs
to achieve for instance the respect of a sizing field by mesh elements,
some topological conditions on the representation of boundary surfaces in the mesh,
and/or some error bound for the approximation of boundary surfaces.
To some extend, the user may tune the Delaunay refinement
to a prescribed trade-off between mesh quality and mesh density.
The mesh density refers to the number of mesh vertices and cells,
i.e.\ to the complexity of the mesh.
The mesh quality referred to here is measured by the radius edge
ratio of surface facets end mesh cells, where the radius edge ratio of
a simplex (triangle or tetrahedron) is the
the ratio between its circumradius and its shortest edge.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3Protectionof0and1dimensionalExposed Protection of 0 and 1-dimensional Exposed Features

If the domain description includes 0 dimensional features,
the corresponding points are inserted into the Delaunay triangulation
from the start.

If the domain has 1-dimensional exposed features,
the method of protecting balls \cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07}, \cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07}
is used to achieve an accurate representation of those features in the mesh
and to guarantee that the refinement process terminates
whatever may be the dihedral angles formed by input surface patches incident to a
given 1-feature or the angles formed by two 1-features incident to a 0-feature.
See Section \ref Mesh_3Protectionof0and1dimensionalExposed in the documentation
of the `Mesh_3` package for further information.

How to prescribe sharp features and examples of periodic meshes with features are presented
in Section \ref Periodic_3_mesh_3MeshingDomainswithSharpFeatures.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3OptimizationPhase Optimization Phase

The optimization phase is a succession of optimization processes who aim to
improve the quality of the mesh in terms of shape and size of its elements.
All the optimizers offered by `Mesh_3` are also available for periodic mesh
generation:

- The Lloyd and odt-smoother are global optimizers, moving the mesh vertices
to minimize a mesh energy.
- The perturber and the exuder are local optimizers, focusing on improving
the worst mesh elements.

See Sections \ref Mesh_3OptimizationPhase, \ref Mesh_3TheOptimizationParameters,
and \ref Mesh_3TuningMeshOptimization Tuning Mesh Optimization
in the documentation of the `Mesh_3` package for further information.

\section Periodic_3_mesh_3_section_interface Interface

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheGlobalFunctions The Global Functions

A periodic 3D mesh generation process is launched through a call
to one of the two following functions:

\code{.cpp}
template <class C3T3, class PeriodicMeshDomain, class MeshCriteria>
C3T3 make_periodic_3_mesh_3(MeshDomain domain,
                            MeshCriteria criteria,
                            parameters::internal::Features_options features = parameters::features(domain),
                            parameters::internal::Lloyd_options lloyd = parameters::no_lloyd(),
                            parameters::internal::Odt_options odt = parameters::no_odt(),
                            parameters::internal::Perturb_options perturb = parameters::perturb(),
                            parameters::internal::Exude_options exude = parameters::exude());

template <class C3T3, class MeshDomain, class MeshCriteria>
void refine_periodic_3_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3,
                              PeriodicMeshDomain domain,
                              MeshCriteria criteria,
                              parameters::internal::Lloyd_options lloyd = parameters::no_lloyd(),
                              parameters::internal::Odt_options odt = parameters::no_odt(),
                              parameters::internal::Perturb_options perturb = parameters::perturb(),
                              parameters::internal::Exude_options exude = parameters::exude());
\endcode

The function `make_periodic_3_mesh_3()` generates from scratch a periodic mesh
of the input domain, while the function `refine_periodic_3_mesh_3()` refines
an existing periodic mesh of the input domain.

\warning The triangulation must form at all times a simplicial complex within
a single copy of the domain. It is the responsibility of the user to provide
a triangulation that satisfies this condition when calling the refinement
function `refine_periodic_3_mesh_3`.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheDataStructure The Data Structure

The template parameter `C3T3` is required to be a model of
the concept `MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3`, a data structure devised to
represent a three-dimensional complex embedded in a 3D triangulation.
In both functions, an instance of type `C3T3` is used to maintain the current
approximating simplicial mesh and to represent the final 3D mesh at the end
of the procedure.

The embedding periodic 3D triangulation is required to be the nested type
`CGAL::Periodic_3_mesh_triangulation_3::type`, provided by the meta functor
`CGAL::Periodic_3_mesh_triangulation_3`. The type for this triangulation is a
wrapper around `CGAL::Periodic_3_regular_triangulation_3` whose vertex and cell
base classes are respectively models of the concepts `MeshVertexBase_3` and
`MeshCellBase_3`.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheDomainOracleandtheFeaturesParameter The Domain Oracle and the Features Parameter

The template parameter `PeriodicMeshDomain` is required to be a model of
the concept `Periodic_3MeshDomain_3`. The argument `domain` of type
`PeriodicMeshDomain` is the sole link through which the periodic domain
to be discretized is known by the mesh generation algorithm.

This concept provides, among others, member functions to test whether or not
a query segment intersects boundary surfaces, and to compute an intersection point
in the affirmative.
The `Periodic_3MeshDomain_3` concept adds member functions which given a query point
tell whether the point lies inside or outside the domain and in which subdomain
the point lies, if inside.

If the domain description includes 0 and 1-dimensional features
that have to be accurately represented in the final mesh,
the template parameter `PeriodicMeshDomain` is required to be
of a model of the refined concept `Periodic_3MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`.
The concept `Periodic_3MeshDomainWithFeatures_3` mainly provides the incidence
graph of 0, 1 and 2-dimensional features, and a member function to construct
sample points on curves.

Using the parameter of type `Features`, the user
whose domain is a model of `Periodic_3MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`
can choose to have the corners and curves of the domain
represented in the mesh or not.
The type `Features` of this parameter is an internal undescribed type.
The library provides functions to construct appropriate values of that type.
<UL>
<LI>`parameters::features()` sets features according to the domain,
i.e.\ 0 and 1-dimensional features are taken into account if `domain` is a
`MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`.
<LI>`parameters::no_features()` prevents the representation
of 0 and 1-dimensional features in the mesh. This is useful to get a smooth and rough approximation
of a domain with features.
</UL>

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3TheMeshingCriteria The Meshing Criteria

The template parameter `MeshCriteria` must be a model of the concept
`MeshCriteria_3`, or a model of the refined concept `MeshCriteriaWithFeatures_3`
if the domain has exposed features.
The argument of type `MeshCriteria` passed to the mesh generator specifies the
size and shape requirements for the tetrahedra in the mesh
and for the triangles in the boundary surface mesh. These criteria
condition the rules that drive the refinement process. At the end
of the refinement process, mesh elements satisfy the criteria.
This may not be strictly true anymore after the optimization phase, but this
last phase is devised to only improve the mesh quality.

The periodic mesher makes use of the same criteria as the non-periodic meshing functions.
This is made possible because criteria use methods directly
from the underlying triangulation, to know the smallest edge length of a triangle,
for example. The periodicity is therefore taken into account at this level and
no modification of the criteria classes are required.

The criteria for surface facets are governed by the four following
parameters:
<UL>
<LI><I>`facet_angle`.</I> This parameter controls the shape of
surface facets. Actually, it is a lower bound for the angle (in degree) of
surface facets. When boundary surfaces are smooth, the termination of the meshing process is
guaranteed if the angular bound is at most 30
degrees.
<LI><I>`facet_size`.</I> This parameter controls the size of surface facets.
Actually, each surface facet has
a surface Delaunay ball which is a ball circumscribing the surface facet and
centered on the surface patch. The parameter `facet_size` is
either a constant or a spatially variable scalar field, providing an
upper bound for the radii of surface Delaunay balls.
<LI><I>`facet_distance`.</I> This parameter controls the approximation error of boundary and subdivision surfaces.
Actually, it is
either a constant or a spatially variable scalar field. It
provides an upper bound for the distance between the circumcenter
of a surface facet and the center of a surface Delaunay ball of this facet.
<LI><I>`facet_topology`.</I> This parameters controls the set of topological constraints
which have to be verified by each surface facet. By default, each vertex of a surface
facet has to be located on a surface patch, on a curve, or on a corner. It can
also be set to check whether the three vertices of a surface facet belongs to the same
surface patch. This has to be done cautiously, as such a criteria needs that each surface
patches intersection is an input 1-dimensional feature.
</UL>

The criteria for mesh cells are governed by two parameters:
<UL>
<LI><I>`cell_radius_edge_ratio`.</I> This parameter controls the
shape of mesh cells (but can't filter slivers, as we discussed earlier).
Actually, it is an upper bound for the ratio
between the circumradius of a
mesh tetrahedron and its shortest edge.
There is a theoretical bound for this parameter:
the Delaunay refinement process is guaranteed to terminate
for values of `cell_radius_edge_ratio` bigger than 2.
<LI><I>`cell_size`.</I>
This parameter controls the size of mesh tetrahedra.
It is either a scalar or a spatially variable scalar field.
It provides an upper bound on the circumradii of the
mesh tetrahedra.
</UL>

Note that if a sizing field is used in the edge criterion, it must naturally
have the same periodicity as the fundamental periodic domain.

\section Periodic_3_mesh_3_section_examples Examples

This section presents various use cases of the periodic mesh generator.

\section Periodic_3_mesh_3SubMultipleCopies Outputting Multiple Copies of a Periodic Mesh

Generated meshes can be output to the `.mesh` file format, which can be read
with `medit`. The function `output_to_medit()` takes a stream, a mesh
complex, and - optionally - the number of periodic copies that should be drawn,
making it easier to observe the periodicity of the result.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_copies} illustrates the different output
for the three possible number of copies: `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_33DDomainsImplicitIsosurfaces 3D Periodic Domains Bounded by Implicit Isosurfaces
The following code produces a 3D periodic mesh for a domain whose boundary surface
is an isosurface defined by an implicit function.
Note the use of named parameters (from the Boost library) in the
constructor of the `Mesh_criteria` instance.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_shape} shows the resulting mesh.

\cgalExample{Periodic_3_mesh_3/mesh_implicit_shape.cpp}

A single instance of a periodic mesh produced from an implicit domain (left).
Cut view (middle). Another cut is shown, with 7 copies (right).
\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

While the implicit function used in the previous example is defined and periodic
over the complete space, it is also possible to consider an implicit function
defined entirely within the fundamental domain. It will then be periodically
duplicated. For example, replacing the previous domain and with the following
implicit function (a sphere):

\code{.cpp}
...
// A sphere centered on (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) with radius sqrt(0.2)
FT sphere_function (const Point& p) { return CGAL::squared_distance(p, Point(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) - 0.2; }
...
Periodic_mesh_domain domain(sphere_function, CGAL::Iso_cuboid_3<K>(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1));
...
\endcode

will yield the mesh shown on Figure \cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_sphere}.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3MeshingMultipleDomains Meshing Multiple Domains

The following code produces a 3D periodic mesh for a domain consisting of a combination
of the two implicit functions used in the previous example: a sphere is encompassed
within the implicit domain of Figure \cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_implicit_shape}.
The class `Implicit_multi_domain_to_labeling_function_wrapper` is used as model
of `ImplicitFunction`, required by the class `Labeled_periodic_3_mesh_domain_3`.
The set of subdomains is given by a vector of vector of signs.
Each subdomain corresponds to a sign vector `[s1, s2, ..., sn]`,
where `si` is the sign of the function `fi(p)` at a point `p` of the subdomain.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_multi_domain} shows a view and a cut view of the resulting mesh.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3Optimizers Tuning Mesh Optimization

In the previous examples, the mesh generation is launched through a call
`make_periodic_3_mesh_3()` with a minimal number of parameters. In such cases,
the default optimization strategy is applied: after the Delaunay refinement process
two optimization steps are performed, a perturbation and a sliver exudation.
The following example shows how to enable and disable the various optimization methods.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_multi_domain} shows the resulting periodic mesh
before and after optimizations.

\subsection Periodic_3_mesh_3MeshingDomainswithSharpFeatures Meshing Domains with Sharp Features

The periodic mesh generator currently operates on domains described by one or
multiple implicit functions. Sharp features that wish to be preserved
must then be explicitly specified by hand by the user, using the mesh domain
class `CGAL::Mesh_domain_with_polyline_features_3` and the functions `add_features()`
and `add_corner()`. These functions allow to specify `curves` (as a polyline,
a list of points with two consecutive points forming a segment of the curve) and
`corners` which should appear in the final mesh.
Note that the discretization of the specified curves might change: for example,
a curve might be subdivided in smaller segments (but it will still be present
in the final mesh).

To ensure the good protection of features, some requirements are put on the curves
and corners that are specified by the user:
- A corner can only belong to a curve if it is an endpoint of that curve.
- A curve cannot self-intersect, except at its endpoint (it then forms a so-called `cycle`).
- Two curves cannot intersect, except at a common endpoint.

\warning Curves and corners do not need to be restricted to the fundamental
periodic domain, but users should be mindful that curves and corners will exist
in all copies of the domain and the requirements described above must still be verified.
For example, if considering a unit cube, it is not a valid input
to prescribe a corner at the point `(1.5, 1.5, 1.5)` and the curve `(2,2,2)--(3,3,3)`
because the corner intersects the curve in the middle.

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3ConeWithSharpFeatures Example of a Cone-like Periodic Domain

The example below uses two different types of protecting features: a cycle to
protect the base of the cone, and a corner at the apex of a cone, which ensures
that the apex will appear in the mesh.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_protection} shows the comparison between
the same domain meshed with the same criteria when protection is disabled and enabled.

\cgalExample{Periodic_3_mesh_3/mesh_implicit_shape_with_protection.cpp}

and the apex of the cone are badly approximated when protection is unused (left).
Using protection, we obtain a faithful approximation.
\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

\subsubsection Periodic_3_mesh_3InfiniteFeatures Example of Infinite Protecting Curves

It is possible to prescribe features that will, due to periodicity, extend indefinitely
in space. A simple example of such occurrence is the segment `(0,0,0) -- (1,1,1)` when
considering the unit cube as fundamental domain.
\cgalFigureRef{Periodic_3_mesh_3Periodic_protection} shows a domain where sharp edges
can be protected to obtain a nicer result.
